"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Patients often have advanced liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) and may have clubbing, cyanosis or hypoxaemia and/or portal HTN, with splenomegaly, ascites and telangiectasia on the skin of the upper torso.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Doppler imaging shows no colour flow in the interatrial septum.On injection of agitated saline, microbubbles are seen in the left atrium after several cardiac cycles (typically 4 to 8) and not immediately as seen in PFO.A trans-oesophageal echo may further delineate the exact crossover site.If the microbubbles appear in the left atrium without crossing at the fossa ovalis, then AVM is possible.Laboratory findings may show abnormal LFTs, coagulopathy and low serum albumin.Contrast-enhanced CT scanning may illustrate the AVMs.</p>",
