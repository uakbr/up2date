"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> Unlike WAS, ITP is not present from birth and is not familial. Clinical features can be very similar, as eczema is frequent in children and not all WAS patients have a significant infectious history. The existence of other affected family members suggests WAS.",
