"<p><strong>Sign & Symptoms:</strong> May be clinically indistinguishable from PTC.",
"<br><strong>Test:</strong> Intracranial pathology will be readily evident on MRI or magnetic resonance venogram of the brain, and these procedures can aid in differentiating between anomalies.Brain tumours, venous sinus thromboses, meningiomas infiltrating the venous sinuses, and other space-occupying lesions severe enough to cause increased intracranial pressure and papilloedema are usually obvious on neuroimaging. Cryptic arteriovenous malformations or dural fistulae with high flow may overload venous return and increase intracranial pressure.</p>",
